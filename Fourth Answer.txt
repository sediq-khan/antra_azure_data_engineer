ETL vs ELT:

Both ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) do the exact same task, except that the order is different. We need ETL in a big data environment, because our data is assumed to be scattered across different platforms with different interfaces and hence different data-structures.

We Extract data from all those different platforms into one consolidated staging platform in the ETL eco-system. We then go ahead and cleanse, enrich and mask (Transform) before we load it into the Warehouse. By doing so, we comply with standards by masking the data and changing it.

ETL wins over ELT in a number of ways, including ETL being more OLAP ready, meaning, when we choose ETL, our data gets transformed before its deposited (loaded) in to our Warehouse and hence any OLAP/ Data Analysis service that uses it, the data would already be clean and ready-to-use. However, in ELT, we Extract the data from different platforms and Load them into our Warehouse and never technically gets transformed and before we feed it to our OLAP/ analysis, we will have to actually transform it.

Lastly, the processes for ETL are more streamlined and standardized and more widely used/ accepted than ELT.
